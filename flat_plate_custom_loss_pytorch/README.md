## Flat plate problem with custom loss (filtered differentiation)

The current problem is set up in **Modulus 22.07** and is supported with **Pytorch** in the backend.

> Cuda graph is warming up with no error. However, when it enters the 'graph creation mode' it fails with `Runtime error: Unable to perform operation while streaming`. It appears that lack of cuda graph knowledge is leading to this error. Will be resolving it ASAP.

> More details will be added once CUDA graph error is rectified.
